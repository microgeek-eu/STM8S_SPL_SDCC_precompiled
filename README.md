This is the set of batch files used to create .lib files with precompiled STM8S Standard Peripherial Library (not included).

To compile you need SDCC 3.9.0 compiler and patched STM8S SPL files. How to patch has been explained in https://microgeek.eu/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=2026

At the moment three scripts are available (Only these uC I have to test the result):

* for STM8S103
* for STM8S105
* for STM8S207
